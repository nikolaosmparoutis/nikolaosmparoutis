- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I found machine learning and data science like this: I had half finish my first thesis on desiging of low consumption analog electronics for photovoltaics, i stoped it to begin a new thesis on control system.  Their architectures were more interesting, researching a lot i found connections with something  consisting of maths, data, programming, patterns and abstract thinking and control systems, it was a match! I altered it with my professor from control systems to machine learning and i liked it a lot, they talled me "You have to stop sometime, you reach the double size of a thesis." I did not.I gave them the 2/3 of the final size, as stuborn and hungry i continued and invented some tricks alone which now i find as superb.
