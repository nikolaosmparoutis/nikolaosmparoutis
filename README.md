- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I found machine learning and data science like this: I had half finish my first thesis on desiging of low consumption analog electronics for photovoltaics, i stoped it to begin a new thesis on control system.  Their architectures were more interesting, researching a lot i found connections with something called machine learning, it uses maths, data, programming, patterns and abstract thinking, it was a match! I altered it with my professor from control systems to machine learning and i liked it a lot, they talled  "You have to stop sometime, it is too big, you reach the double size of a thesis." ... But as stuborn and hungry i did not. I invented some things alone which now i find as superb ideas.
